      <description>Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system that provides a wide range of tools for data processing, analytics, and machine learning. It&amp;rsquo;s a popular choice for many organizations due to its ability to scale and its support for a wide range of programming languages. However, like any complex system, there are a few gotchas that users should be aware of when working with Spark. In this post, I will cover some of the most common gotchas that I learned while working with Spark, it will also be a sort of summary of some concepts I read about in the Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Big Data Analysis book (link).</description>
